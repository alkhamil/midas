# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation.

## Layout

Single-context repo:

```
/
├── GLOSSARY.md
├── docs/adr/
└── src/
```

## Before exploring, read these

- **`GLOSSARY.md`** at the repo root.
- **`docs/adr/`**: read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.
- **`docs/behavior-spec.md`**: the spec for the Behavior engine. Source of truth for Behavior decisions.

If any of these files don't exist, proceed silently.

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `GLOSSARY.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders), but worth reopening because…_
